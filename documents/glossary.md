# Glossary

*  This glossary contains key terms and concepts related to containerization, virtualization, and related technologies used throughout the project. The terms are listed alphabetically for easy reference.

## Containerization 

* **[Containerization](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Containerizations-vs-Virtualization.md)** is a lightweight form of virtualization that packages an application and its dependencies into a "container," which can run consistently across different computing environments.

## Docker

* **[Docker](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Docker.md)** is a platform that uses containerization to package software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

## Kubernetes vs. Docker

* **[Kubernetes](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Kubernetes-vs-Docker.md)** is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

* **[Docker](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Kubernetes-vs-Docker.md)** provides the platform for packaging and running containers, while Kubernetes provides the orchestration needed to manage multiple containers in production.

## Key Concepts

* **[Kernel](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Key-Concepts.md)** - The core of an operating system, managing hardware resources and providing essential services to software.

* **[Thread/Threading](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Key-Concepts.md)** - A unit of execution within a process. Threading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within a process.

* **[Single-Threading](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Key-Concepts.md)** - Running one thread at a time in sequence.

* **[Multi-Threading](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Key-Concepts.md)** - Running multiple threads concurrently within the same process.

* **[Parallelization](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Key-Concepts.md)** - A method of processing multiple tasks simultaneously by dividing tasks across multiple processors or cores.

## Orchestration and Container Management

* **[Orchestration](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Orchestration%20and%20Container%20Management.md)** refers to the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex computer systems and services, often used in managing containers in production environments.

* **[Container Management](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Orchestration%20and%20Container%20Management.md)** involves the process of managing container lifecycles, including deployment, scaling, networking, and monitoring of containers.

## Scaling

* **[Scaling](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Scaling.md)** refers to the ability to increase or decrease computing resources to handle varying levels of demand. Scaling can be vertical (adding more power to an existing machine) or horizontal (adding more machines to distribute the load).

## Software Packaging

* **[Software Packaging](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/SoftwarePackaging.md)** is the process of bundling an application and its dependencies so that it can be installed and run consistently across different environments. Containers are a modern form of software packaging.

## Twelve-Factor App

* **[Twelve-Factor-App](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/TwelveFactorApp.md)** is a methodology for building software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications that emphasizes best practices like clean separation of environments, scalability, and automated setup for deployment.

## Virtualization

* **[Virtualization](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Containerizations-vs-Virtualization.md)** refers to the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as virtual hardware platforms, storage devices, and network resources. It allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine.

## Virtualization Technology (History)

* **[Virtualization History](https://github.com/jar285/UFO-JA373/blob/main/documents/Virtualization%20Technology.md)** - Virtualization has evolved since the 1960s, starting with the IBM CP-40 and CP-67, to create virtual machines. It has expanded through the development of hypervisors and cloud technologies, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single machine.
